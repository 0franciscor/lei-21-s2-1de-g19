# US 05 - As a medical lab technician, I want to record samples collected in the scope of a given test.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a medical lab technician, I want to record samples collected in the scope of a given test.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

From the Specifications Document:

* "(...) until a medical lab technician calls him/her to collect the samples required to perform a given test." (n√£o sei se deve estar aqui)
* "All the tests (clinical blood tests and Covid-19 tests) performed by the network of laboratories are registered locally by the medical lab technicians who collect the samples."
* "When sampling (blood or swab) the medical lab technician records the samples in the system, associating the samples with the client/test, and identifying each sample with a barcode that is automatically generated using an external API."

From the client clarifications:

* Question: "Will there be a need to link each sample and the collection method(s) used? If so, is it associated when creating a test (US4) or when registering the samples collected (US5)? And is(are) the collection method(s) associated with the sample or with each of the parameters? Will the user be able to input a custom date/hour for each sample collected or should the system assume the current time?"
    * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8260#p10800) ""


* Question: "What kind of attributes should a sample have? Can a test have more than one sample? We didn't fully understand what will the API do in this US, so here's out interpretation from the US, correct us if we're wrong please: The API will be generated randomly and the API is an attribute from the sample. In the US acceptance criteria, it's also said that: "The API to use is defined by configuration.", does this means the medical lab technician is the one who chooses which kind of API wants to use for a certain sample?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244#p10782) ""


* Question: "Which will be the format of the configuration file? What information will be in that file and will it follow a specific format? If so, which format?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8243#p10781) ""


* Question: "What are the attributes that Samples have and what are her restrictions? Which type/types of barcode Many Labs will use?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8234#p10771) ""


* Question: "Studying the user story 5 I had a doubt regarding the registration of a sample, namely which are the attributes that a sample has, and their restrictions."

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* AC1:"The system should support several barcode APIs. The API to use is defined by configuration."

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

*Identify here any found out dependency to other US and/or requirements.*

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

Input Data

* Typed data:

  * 


* Selected data:

  * 


Output Data

* (In)Success of the operation


### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

*Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered.*

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

*Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as (i) special requirements ; (ii) data and/or technology variations; (iii) how often this US is held.* 


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt 
*In this section, it is suggested to present an excerpt of the domain model that is seen as relevant to fulfill this requirement.*

### 2.2. Other Remarks

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 4  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RecordSamplesUI  
 * RecordSamplesController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US05-SD](US05-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
