# US 05 - As a medical lab technician, I want to record samples collected in the scope of a given test.

## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As a medical lab technician, I want to record samples collected in the scope of a given test.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

From the Specifications Document:

* "(...) until a medical lab technician calls him/her to collect the samples required to perform a given test." (n√£o sei se deve estar aqui)
* "All the tests (clinical blood tests and Covid-19 tests) performed by the network of laboratories are registered locally by the medical lab technicians who collect the samples."
* "When sampling (blood or swab) the medical lab technician records the samples in the system, associating the samples with the client/test, and identifying each sample with a barcode that is automatically generated using an external API."

From the client clarifications:

* Question: "Will there be a need to link each sample and the collection method(s) used? If so, is it associated when creating a test (US4) or when registering the samples collected (US5)? And is(are) the collection method(s) associated with the sample or with each of the parameters? Will the user be able to input a custom date/hour for each sample collected or should the system assume the current time?"
    * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8260#p10800) ""


* Question: "What kind of attributes should a sample have? // Can a test have more than one sample? // We didn't fully understand what will the API do in this US, so here's out interpretation from the US, correct us if we're wrong please: The API will be generated randomly and the API is an attribute from the sample."
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8244#p10782) "Each sample is associated with a test. A sample has only one attribute, a barcode number (UPC) that is a sequential number and is automatically generated by the system. Each sample has a unique barcode number. In US5, the medical lab technician checks the system and see all tests for which there are no samples collected. The medical lab technician selects a test and the system asks for the number of samples to collect. // Yes. // The API will be used to generate/print barcodes."
  

* Question: "Studying the user story 5 I had a doubt regarding the registration of a sample, namely which are the attributes that a sample has, and their restrictions."
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8201#p10729) ""


* Question: "What information does the medical lab technician needs to input to the record a new sample?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8360#p10930) "The medical lab technician checks a list of tests and selects one. Then, the application generates barcodes (one or more). After printing the barcodes (one or more) the use case ends."


* Question: "The code represented in the barcode is introduced by the user, generated or is it the one generated during the creation of the test by the receptionist (US4)?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8478#p11102) ""


* Question: "It was answered in one of the previous questions that the sample only has one attribute, the barcode, however the description of the project also mentions a date of collection of the samples, is this date supposed to be an attribute of the test and not of the sample itself? If there were multiple samples for a single test, would there be only one collection date for all of them?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8450#p11069) ""


* Question: "Why is there the specification for only the tests with no samples? Shouldn't there be a way for technicians to add more samples to an existing test? // Should there be a validation of the number of samples? // After the barcodes are generated. The concept-reality link would be, for example to stick each barcode into each sample?"
  * [Answer:](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8437#p11052) ""

*Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams).* 



## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1: requests to see the tests with samples to be collected |	... interacting with the actor? | RecordSamplesUI         | Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model. |
|                                                                |  ... coordinating the US?        | RecordSamplesController | Controller |
|                                                                |                                  |                                   |                        |
| Step 2: shows the tests and asks to select one |	... knowing the tests to show? | RecordSamplesUI and TestStore            | IE and Creator: UI is responsible for showing it and the Test Store is able to retrieve the available tests. |
| Step 3: selects one test | 							 |             |                              |
| Step 4: requests data (number of samples to be collected) |							 |             |                              |
| Step 5: types requested data |							 |             |                              |
| Step 6: shows the data and requests a confirmation |	n/a						 |             |                              |              
| Step 7: confirms the data |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 8: generates the sample barcode and informs operation success |							 |             |                              |              

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * RecordSamplesUI  
 * RecordSamplesController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view stating the sequence of domain related software objects' interactions that allows to fulfill the requirement.* 

![US05-SD](US05-SD.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

*In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main domain related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirement as well as and their relations, attributes and methods.*

![US05-CD](US05-CD.svg)

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 5. Construction (Implementation)

*In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits.*

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.* 

# 6. Integration and Demo 

*In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system.*


# 7. Observations

*In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work.*
