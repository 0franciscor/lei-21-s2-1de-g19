# US4 - As a receptionist, I entend to register a test

## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

As a receptionist of the laboratory, I intend to register a test to be performed to a registered client.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

From the Specifications Document:

* "Once there, a receptionist asks the client’s citizen card number, the lab order (which contains the type of test and parameters to be measured), and registers in the application the test to be performed to that client."

From the client clarifications:

* Question: Other than the attributes already mentioned (test code, NHS code, designation) are there any other attributes that characterize a test? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8145)
    * Answer: The test attributes are: Test code : Sequential number with 12 digits. The code is automatically generated.
      NHS code: 12 alphanumeric characters.
      
* Question: On those attributes, what requirements are there? For example, the characters on a designation, the code length, etc [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8145)
    * Answer: The test attributes are: Test code : Sequential number with 12 digits. The code is automatically generated.
      NHS code: 12 alphanumeric characters.
      
* Question: When the receptionist chooses the test type, should the categories appear, and then when selecting the category, the receptionist can choose the parameters for the test? Or when the Receptionist chooses the test type, should appear all the parameters that it includes immediately? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8181)
    * Answer: Firstly, the receptionist should choose a test type. Then choose a category from a set of categories. Last, the receptionist should choose a parameter.
  
* Question: When the recepcionist is supposed to insert the lab order in the system, does he need to insert something that defines it ( like a code ) or does the recepcionist need to insert the type of test and parameters to be measured that are contained in the lab order? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8197)
    * Answer:

* Question: What exactly the client wishes is to create an authentication of the lab client based on their citizen card number. Simply put, to recognize a registered client, we must identify them by their CCN. Is that right? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8199)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: I would like to ask what other parameters aside the one already metion does de receptionist need to register a new tes. [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8205)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: The receptionist needs to choose a registered client, is the client identified only by the citizen card number? Or is there other information needed? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8208)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: How does the receptionist choose the client? Writing the data or choosing from the client's list? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8208)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: The receptionist needs to choose a type of test, how is it identified? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8208)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: How does the receptionist choose the type of test? Writing the data or choosing from the type of test's list? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8208)
    * Answer:

    * Answer:
  
* Question: One of the attributes that characterizes a test is an NHS Code. Is this code the same as the clients' NHS Number as a means of associating both? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8224)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Through which attribute in the test, would an employee know, which client is the test associated to? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8224)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Is the client profile associated with the test or only a contact through which the client will be notified that their results are available? In case of the former, do the test results need to have some kind of privacy settings (i.e., only that client can see them on the app), or does the client receive a code that can be used to access the results (by him and everyone with access to that code)? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Can the same client be associated to different tests? Does he then have an history of tests performed in the company available in the app? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Are the parameters associated through their respective code, introduced manually by the receptionist, or does the app show a list of parameters? In case of the latter, should the app show the whole list of parameters or should there be a limit of parameters shown, providing the option to go forward or back on the list? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: In case the parameters are selected from a list, which are the parameters that should be shown? The ones associated with the categories which in turn are associated with the chosen type of test? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: In the case of the Covid test, since the result can only be positive/negative, is there a parameter associated? And should the step of choosing a parameter be ignored in this case, i.e., should the app not even ask if the receptionist wants to add a parameter? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: On the project description it says "Each test is characterized by an internal code, an NHS code, a description that identifies the sample collection method...". Are these attributes automatically generated or should they be manually introduced? Is the description automatically filled with the collection method associated with the type of test? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: On the project description we have multiple attributes of date and time ("date and time when the samples were collected", etc). Are these attributes filled by the author of the respective act or is it generated by the system when those acts are performed? And while they're not performed, should these fields show "Not yet performed" or something of the sort? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Should there be a control of the phase of the test, i.e., a field that says "Sample in collection/In analysis/Results Available"? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8236)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Will there be a need to link each sample and the collection method(s) used? If so, is it associated when creating a test (US4) or when registering the samples collected (US5)? And is(are) the collection method(s) associated with the sample or with each of the parameters? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8260)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Since the Client has a Lab Order which contains the type of test and all the parameters to be measured, all the parameters selected by the Receptionist need to be equal to the Lab Order's parameters? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8316)
    * Answer: Yes.
  
* Question: About the other Test attributes, do we need to have in consideration any other criteria? Is the code generated or NHS code ooptional ? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8316)
    * Answer: All test attributes are mandatory. The test attributes are the following: Test code : sequential number with 12 digits. The code is automatically generated.
      NHS code: 12 alphanumeric characters.
      
* Question: I wanted to ask if the NHS code of wich test is unique or not. [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8432)
    * Answer: Yes.
  
* Question: In the case of the Covid test, should the step of choosing a parameter be ignored in this case, i.e., should the app not even ask if the receptionist wants to add a parameter, given that there is only one parameter associated? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8442)
    * Answer: No.
  
* Question: On the project description it says "Each test is characterized by an internal code, an NHS code, a description that identifies the sample collection method...". You said that the code is a 12 digit sequential number. Does this mean that, for example, the first test will have the code "000000000001" and so on? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8442)
    * Answer: Yes.
  
* Question: And should the description that identifies the sample collection method be automatically filled with the collection method associated with the type of test? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8442)
    * Answer: Yes. In a previous post I said that "There exists only one collection method per test type".
  
* Question: On the project description we have multiple attributes of date and time ("date and time when the samples were collected", etc). Are these attributes filled by the author of the respective act or is it generated by the system when those acts are performed? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8442)
    * Answer: The system should automatically generate the date and time of the event (test registration, chemical analysis, diagnosis and validation).
  
* Question: Is the receptionist supposed to choose from a list of Clients or should the receptionist enter the client's NHS number to get the derised client? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8456)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: How is it possible to know in which laboratory the test is being registered? Should the Receptionist select the Laboratory before selecting the Test Type? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8472)
    * Answer: After login the receptionist should select the laboratory where she is working. Then, the receptionist has access to the system's features/functionalities.
  
* Question: Which is the required format for the Dates associated with the test? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8472)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: when the receptionist is registering a test for a client, the test can have more than one category and many parameters of the chosen categories or it only can have one category? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8522)
    * Answer: Each test can have more than one category.
  
* Question: We are aware that both the receptionist and the MLT are two employees that may work on different labs. As such, do you want that Tests become associated to a specific Lab? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8596)
    * Answer: Yes.
  
* Question: This means that, when the receptionist creates a new Test, this test will only be "visible" for that specific LAB (for the receptionist and the MLT only), which means that all other roles (Chemistry Technologist, Specialist Doctor and the Laboratory Coordinator) will be able to see a list of all the tests performed in any lab. [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8596)
    * Answer: Yes. The test will only be visible for that specific LAB and for all those working in the Chemical Laboratory.
  
* Question: Can the client have two identical tests? or the system should stop from creating the same test? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8628)
    * Answer: A test is unique in the system.
  
* Question: You've said on previous questions that the NHS code contains 12 characters and is alphanumeric, so this will be different from the NHS number from the client, am I right? If so, how do we know a certain test is associated to a client? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8630)
    * Answer: A test has a NHS code and a client has a NHS number. In US4 the receptionist of the laboratory should ask the client to get his TIN number. Using the TIN number the receptionist of the laboratory can find all information about the client. Do not forget that a client should be registered in the system to make a test.
  
* Question: Should we show the list of all clients available or just introduce the client's CCN ? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8673)
    * Answer: The TIN number should be used to find a client and associate the client with the test.
  
* Question: Shouldn't the receptionist locate the Client by the Citizen Card Number instead of TIN Number? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8684)
    * Answer: The receptionist should use the TIN number to find the client.
  
* Question: Given that we need to associate a Test with a Client using his/her Tax Identification Number, it could create bugs within the system if there were two Clients with the same TIN. How do you want us to approach this situation? Do you want us to show the clients with that TIN so that the receptionist selects the option or do you prefer we change the previously made code? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8714)
    * Answer: 
  
* Question: How should the test "know" the lab where it was created? Does the receptionist specify it when creating the test? Should that be an attribute of the user session and therefore be implicitly associated? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8730)
    * Answer:
