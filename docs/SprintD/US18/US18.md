## 1. Requirements Engineering

*In this section, it is suggested to capture the requirement description and specifications as provided by the client as well as any further clarification on it. It is also suggested to capture the requirements acceptance criteria and existing dependencies to other requirements. At last, identfy the involved input and output data and depicted an Actor-System interaction in order to fulfill the requirement.*


### 1.1. User Story Description

As an Administrator I want to send the Covid-19 report to the NHS at any time. I want to define the interval of dates to fit the regression model, the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS, the regression model to use and select the independent variables to use.

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

From the Specifications Document:
* " The company is also required to generate daily (automatic) reports with all the information demanded by the NHS and should send them to the NHS using their API. To make the predictions, the NHS contract defines that a linear regression algorithm should be used. The NHS required that both simple linear and multiple linear regression algorithms should be evaluated to select the best model. "

From the client clarifications:

* Question: which significance level should we use for the hypothesis tests? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8890)
    * Answer: The application should allow the user to choose the significance level.
  
* Question: Regarding US18 and US19, it is only one report containing all the tests performed by Many Labs to be sent each time, correct? Or is it one report per laboratory, for example? Or other option? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8892)
    * Answer: The report should contain all the tests made by Many Labs.
  
* Question: Should the report contain the data of all the tests with results (with or without report, with or without validation) or contain only the validated tests? (Or other option?) [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8892)
    * Answer: The NHS Covid report should include statistics computed only from validated tests.

* Question: From the project description it is known "send the forecasts for these same time horizons (the number of Covid-19 cases for the following day, next week and next month)." In the example report we have in moodle, there is a line that says "// Prediction values". Does this mean that after this line we should put our predictions or it refers to the following table? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8910)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: From Sprint D requirements we get "I want to define... the number of historical points (number of days or number of weeks) that must be sent to the NHS". Is the Administrator who must choose between days or weeks? If so, how should he make this choice? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8937)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Regarding US18, we've noticed that in the NHS Report model, the administrator defined the date interval to be between 17/05 and 22/05, but in the prediction table I see 15 results between 13/05 and 29/05. I know that between 17 and 22 there aren't 15 days and I would like to know if the 15 rows in the results table are by design (meaning that the application detected that the administrator wanted 15 historical points and it spanned the date further on both sides to provide the 15 days) or is it an error. [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8941)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Which of the data should take the lead, the number of historical points, or the date range? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8941)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Should the number of historical points have the same range as the date interval defined by the administrator? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8942)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: From the report example we got that the administrator defines the dates interval to fit the model. Which date should the application use to provide the report? Is it the registration date or results registration date? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8944)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: Should we always ask to the user define the current date, or can we get it somewhere else? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8965)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: The data should be send according to day, week and month? This affects the number of tests in general? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8965)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: The dates tha fit the model are selected so that the predictions follow the values from those days? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8965)
    * Answer:
  
* Question: The only variables to be compared to the positive cases are the number of tests and mean age or are there any other variable that you would like to Analyse ? [Client forum](https://moodle.isep.ipp.pt/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=8965)
    * Answer:
    

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* AC1: The system should allow the Administrator to select between a simple linear and multilinear regression model to fit the data. Moreover, the Administrator should be able to choose the independent variable to use with the simple linear regression model (either the number of tests realized or the mean age). The system should send the report using the NHS API (available in moodle).

 * Class1
 * Class2
 * Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 
 * xxxxUI  
 * xxxxController

# 4. Tests 
*In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling.* 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

*It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections.*
